## Development

This is a Next.js project built with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

This site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

The deployment workflow:
1. Builds the Next.js application
2. Exports static files to the `out` directory
3. Deploys those files to the `gh-pages` branch
4. GitHub Pages serves the site from the `gh-pages` branch

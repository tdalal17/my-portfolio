## Final Thoughts

Your portfolio shows strong potential, but currently lacks the depth and proof of work that competitive candidates provide. The technical foundation is solid, but you need to demonstrate practical application of your skills through visible, deployable projects.

Focus on showing, not just telling. Every skill you list should have a corresponding project that demonstrates that skill in action. Your AWS certifications are valuable, but recruiters want to see how you've applied that knowledge in real projects.

The gap between your technical capabilities and their demonstration in your portfolio is the primary barrier to landing interviews. Address this gap, and you'll be competitive for mid-level development positions despite being a recent graduate.
